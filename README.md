# Lay-by - GA Project Three - 7 Days

## Description

Lay-by is a website which aims to provide those in the  van-owning community with useful insider information about locations for van camping. Public users can use the website to view van spots across a number of countries, and are provided with useful insights into the locations, facilities and ratings. As a registered user of the site you are able to add your own new van camping locations and leave reviews and ratings on all spots. 

## Deployment Link

Lay-by was deployed with Heroku and can be experienced [here](http://bit.ly/lay-by).

## Getting Started/Code Installation

Clone or download the Github repo. Open it in the editor of your choice and run npm in your terminal to install all dependencies. 

## Timeframe & Working Team 

I created this website for General Assembly's project three along with my other team members Nick Quirk and Archie Rowan Hamilton. We were given 7 days to build a MERN stack app

## Brief
* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
* Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database
* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. ALLOW time for this.
* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.

## Features
* Sign up for a personal account.
* Create new van camping locations.
* View locations created by others and leave reviews and ratings.
* Search for locations by name and filter search results by countries.

## Technologies Used
* MongoDB
* Express
* React.js
* Node.js
* JavaScript
* JWT
* Axios
* Bcrypt
* Git + GitHub
* BootStrap
* Mapbox
* Cloudinary

## Planning

###Â Wireframe
We used Excalidraw to design roughly how the website would look and function, to define the user journey and  to help us determine the data needed in our schemas and the endpoints that were required for each page. 
Desktop






Mobile





### Project Plan 
We created a Trello board, filled the Tasks section with pages and sections that needed to be done. Each of us would take a TODO, move it to DOING and add their name to it.



## Build/Code Process

THIS NEEDS WORK

### Styling
This was achieved with a combination of Bootstrap and SASS.

## Challenges




## Wins

This was my first time using GitHub as a team. 
We all communicated well, merged early and often(and had few merge conflicts).

## Key Learnings/Takeaways

 

## Future Improvements

* Show the users locations in their profile (already showing their reviews)
* Add in a favorites system and show users favorites in their profile
* A few design changes: larger logo on landing page, larger and bolder font on the location card infographics/text, more info with hover for the infographics.
* Make more of user profile- add bio and add user name with click through to public profile on locations they have added or reviewed.
